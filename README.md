Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree (FEND) - Animal Trading Cards Project

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. It showcases a simple webpage featuring "Animal Trading Cards" where each card displays information about a specific animal. The initial focus of this page is a "White Tiger," with its basic characteristics, a brief description, and an image. The project aims to demonstrate the ability to create responsive, well-structured, and styled web pages using HTML and CSS.

## Project Features

- **Responsive Design**: The webpage adjusts to different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.
- **Animal Information**: Displays basic facts about the white tiger, such as its length, height, weight, and gestation period.
- **Image and Descriptive Text**: Includes an image of the white tiger and descriptive text providing further information about the animal.
- **External Fonts**: Utilizes Google Fonts for styling the text on the page.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and content of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file used to style the page, including layout, fonts, and colors.
- `tiger.jpg`: An image of a white tiger used on the trading card (ensure that this image is available in the same directory or provide a correct path).
